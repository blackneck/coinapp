# Get Started with test project ðŸ¤“

## Notes for reviewers

I preferred to use useContext instead of Redux store because of the simplicity of the stored data. In this particular case with only one field using Redux store seems redundant to me.

## Install Dependencies

In the project directory, run:

`yarn` or `npm i`

## Build and run

### Run project in development mode

`yarn start` or `npm run start`

### Build project for production

`yarn build` or `npm run build`
